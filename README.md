Hello! My name is Miguel Ángel Ávila Rosas, an upcoming programer that is learning a lot of basic program lenguages, such as Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc...
In this section of my Github, you'll learn about all the FrontEnd projects I've been making in 2ºDAW (Web Application Development), and how I've been making my way to

Here is a list of ALL the projects I've made by now:

1.Plantilla03_Ejercicio1: A simple exercise that required using JavaScript to change a text in the HTML pressing a button. I've also used CSS to make an unique style for the pages.
