<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

Hello! My name is Miguel Ángel Ávila Rosas, an upcoming programer that is learning a lot of basic program lenguages, such as Java, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc...
In this section of my Github, you'll learn a FrontEnd project I've been making in DWEC (Development in Client Environment), and how I've been making my way to
build an entire aplication on my own.

<h2>JavaScript explanation</h2>

script.js: Gets the labels with the ID 'boton' and 'resultado' and when the button 'boton' is pressed,calls the function 'mostrar' to change the label with the ID 'resultado'.

funciones.js:</br>
  -mostrar(): Obtains the 'name' atribute from the label 'resultado' and changes the text.

login.js: With this Script, the user will need to know the right username and password to access the web page successfully.</br>
In case the user fails to put the right username and password, they will be asked if they want to try it again. Which will restrart the page.</br>
There are some restrictions that can denie the user and restart the page like:</br>
-Cancel the registration</br>
-There are more than 10 characters in the username.</br>
-There are less than 5 characters in the password.</br>
