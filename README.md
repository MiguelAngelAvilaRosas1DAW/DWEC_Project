<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

Hello! My name is Miguel Ángel Ávila Rosas, an upcoming programer that is learning a lot of basic program lenguages, such as Java, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc...
In this section of my Github, you'll learn a FrontEnd project I've been making in DWEC (Development in Client Environment), and how I've been making my way to
build an entire aplication on my own.
